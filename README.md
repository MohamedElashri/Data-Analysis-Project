# Revisit Supernovae project data

This project goal was to ermined the likelihood of an accelerating universe and therefore a positive cosmological constant, using data from the redshift of Type Ia supernovae.
### Type Ia supernovae

Type Ia supernovae are very bright standard candles, which makes it possible to calculate their distance to earth from the observed luminosity. Type Ia supernovae are rare in most galaxies. This makes them ideal for project's  measurements. 

## My project goal

This project was my graduate data analysis class project at University of Minnesota and and my purpose was to apply what I have learned and reproduce the results of the official collaboration paper [1].
